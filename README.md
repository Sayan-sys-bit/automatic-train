ðŸŽ§ Spotify Tracks Dataset â€” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

ðŸ“– Overview
This project explores the **Spotify Tracks Dataset** to uncover patterns and relationships between different **audio features** (such as danceability, energy, tempo, valence, and acousticness) and a trackâ€™s **popularity**.  
Through visualizations and statistical summaries, this EDA aims to answer â€” *What makes a song popular?*

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used: `spotify_tracks.csv`  
It includes features such as:
- Track and artist information  
- Popularity scores  
- Audio attributes like energy, tempo, danceability, valence, acousticness, etc.  
- Temporal details like year and decade

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Most tracks have **moderate popularity**; only a few achieve high scores.  
- Songs with **medium-to-high energy and danceability** dominate the charts.  
- **English** tracks form the majority, but other languages show growing presence.  
- Over time, songs have become **shorter, louder, and more energetic**.  
- The **major mode** (brighter sound) appears more often in popular songs.
